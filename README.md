# Authors-block Extension For Quarto (Frontiers in Microbiology version)

Forked from kapsner/authors-block and modified based on the format requirements of Frontiers in Microbiology. To use it, install the original extension first (see below), and then replace the file **from_author_info_blocks.lua** from this repository. 

Below is the original readme.

This extension brings the capability to add an author-related header block when rendering docx-documents with Quarto.

The extension adds some modifications to the code originally provided with the lua-filters [scholarly-metadata](https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters/tree/master/scholarly-metadata) (by Albert Krewinkel and Robert Winkler) and [author-info-block](https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters/tree/master/author-info-blocks) (by Albert Krewinkel) in order to make it compatible with Quarto and its [normalized author-block](https://quarto.org/docs/journals/authors.html).  

## Installing

```bash
quarto add kapsner/authors-block
```

Using `authors-block` requires Quarto version >= 1.3.0

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` sub-directory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.
